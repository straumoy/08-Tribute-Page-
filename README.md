Description

A tribute page is a great beginner project to honor someone you admire. It helps you practice HTML structure and formatting, including headings, images, paragraphs, and lists.
Features

    Name of the person
    Photo or image
    Short biography or tribute message
    List of achievements or key facts
    Link to more information (e.g., Wikipedia)

Explanation

This project demonstrates:

    Basic semantic elements for structure and clarity
    <img> and <a> for multimedia and external resources
    <ul> and <li> for achievements or milestones
    target="_blank" to open external links in a new tab

It’s simple to personalize this for any historical figure, mentor, or icon.
